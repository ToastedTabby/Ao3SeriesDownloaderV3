# Ao3 Series Downloader

A simple, open-source browser plugin that adds a 'Download Series' button in
Ao3. Works in Chrome; Firefox and Edge are untested.

*Note: You need to be logged into AO3 to see the Download Series button.*

## Installation Instructions
I don't know how to make an extension and frankly have no interest in doing so, as sideloading it works just fine for me, so I've removed the original creator's note here about downloading the browser extensions. I only use Chrome, so I don't know how the Firefox or Edge extensions are and if they still work, but if you're interested in those, please see the original creator's page [here](https://github.com/SeanZWrites/Ao3SeriesDownloader).


### Sideloading in Chrome
Once this extension is downloaded:
  - Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser
  - Enable developer mode by toggling the switch on the upper right.
  - Then click 'Load Unpacked', and navigate to this folder. 
  
You should see this extension appear.


## Acknowledgements
The icon for this extension was built using the free icons provided on
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

Thank you to [SeanZWrites](https://github.com/SeanZWrites) for the original code; all I've done is updated the manifest for V3 compatibility according to [Chrome's V3 migration checklist](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/checklist). If SeanZWrites ever updates the extension, I'll delete this fork as unnecessary.
